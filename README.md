&nbsp; :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: A component shouldn‚Äôt include logic to fetch data, and data shouldn‚Äôt be stored in a component‚Äôs state. <br />
&nbsp; :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: Redux holds up the state within a single location. <br />
&nbsp; :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: With Redux the logic for fetching and managing the state lives outside React. <br />
&nbsp; :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: Redux gives each React component the exact piece of state it needs. <br />
&nbsp; :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: Redux says that the state is immutable and cannot be changed in place. <br />
&nbsp; :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: Even when using Redux it is totally fine to have stateful components. Not every piece of the application‚Äôs state should go inside Redux. <br />
&nbsp; :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: The tradeoff that Redux offers is to add indirection to decouple ‚Äúwhat happened‚Äù from ‚Äúhow things change‚Äù. <br />
